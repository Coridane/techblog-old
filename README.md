  # Tech Blog

  ## Description

  This is a blogging website called Tech Talk.
  
  From here, you may create a post, view your posts from the dashboard, or view all posts from the homepage.
  
  From the dashboard, you may edit or delete your posts. You may also leave a comment from the dashboard or homepage.

  The technologies used includes bcrypt, sequelize and its session store, dotenv, express, handlebars, and mysql2.
  
  The challenge that I faced during this project involved several errors, but one was caused by casing: I originally had "class comment extends model," but it needed to be: "class Comment extends Model."
    
  Future development would include the option to edit your posts from the homepage and after clicking Save, the text box should clear.
